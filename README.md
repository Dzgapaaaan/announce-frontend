Frontend for the SA:MP alternative masterlist - backend API: https://github.com/Southclaws/announce-backend

Very early in development! Also **my first** Javascript, Typescript *and* ReactJS project so feel free to criticise and point out mistakes and bad practice :)

## Screenshots

Simple, minimal design. Anyone can add a server to the list:

This also allows extra information to be associated with a server, such as a banner:

(note that this is just a mockup with a random server and a random image that are completely unrelated!)
